# snmp-client

snmp client written in python using the library pysnmp

## Installation

To run the program you only need to launch "main.exe" in the /dist folder.<br><br>
Alternatively if you have at least python 3 installed on your system, you can install pysnmp with the following command:

```
pip install pysnmp
```

and then you'd have to run "main.py"
